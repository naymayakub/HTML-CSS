		That morning Zain woke up at dawn and went to pray fajr prayers as he used to every morning. When he came back he had his breakfast and went to work. Zain never spoke alot, he was a quiet man with less words and no one ever knew what he was thinking. When Zain was driving to work past the road he saw a woman who was helpless and asking for a lift, even though zain was not one to help others alot he stopped his car and gave her a lift. Along the way they talked for some time and for the first time zain was having a conversation with someone.Alomg the way they talked for some time and for the first time zain was having a conversation with someone.
		<p>The lady was so beautiful to behold! 
			<p>Zain said to himself,
			"trully angels exist."</P>
			<P>When they got to town the lady thanked zain so much for the lift and they exchanged numbers so they could talk more.</P>
			<p>"Theres something about this lady" Zain said as he smiled to himself.</p>
			 <p> He drove off to work and wished he could meet the mysterious lady again.</p>
			<p>That evening while he was driving home, he decided to use a shortcut while passing along an alley he saw some men harrasing a woman by the streets. Whaat he said then moved fast out of his car to help the woman.
				<p>"Wow!"He gasped,</p>
				<p>It was the same woman he was thinking about. He beat up the guys and helped the lady to her feet so they could escape.He took the lady to her home and she was very thankful.</p>
				<p>The next day Zain woke up a little late and proceeded to go to work after missing morning prayers. Before he could leave the cops showed up and cuffed him on charges of murder. He was so surprised. Later he learnt that the girl he helped was killed last night and he was the main suspect. The murder weapon was a kitchen knife with his prints and the cctv recordings showed that he was the last to be with her. Zain's world came crumbling down.</p>

 <p>The murder weapon was a kitchen knife with his prints and the cctv recordings showed that he was the last to be with her. Zain's world came crumbling down
With all the odds against him he gave up and lost all hope. The day he was taken to Court the judge crossed all the evidence and it was clear as a blue sky he was guilty. When asked to take a plead he pleaded guilty because he felt he had nothing more to live for. With that he was sentences to life imprisonment and thats how he landed in jail.</p>
<p> With fourteen years behind bars he had lost all hope and his family forgot any traces of him,till someone showed up a good friend of his came from abroad and was eager to meet his friend zain. When they met he heard his friends story and was so disappointed he couldnt help but he vowed to help his friendHe searched every nook and cranny for the littlest of clues to solve the case. There was no hope untill he stumbled upon a tape from the cctv showing three people commit the murder and leave the incriminating evidence.</p>
<p>"Wheew! What a relief with this new evidence!"</p>
<p>They pleaded the case and won succesfully making zain a free man again! He learnt that keeping quiet was a very bad thing he has done to himself. Had he not keep quiet he would have helped himself out of the jail.
He vowed never to keep shut again.</p>
